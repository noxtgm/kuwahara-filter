# Kuwahara Filter

Adjustable Kuwahara filter effect for Unreal Engine's post process component.

> [!CAUTION]
>  that works for both Unreal Engine 4.X and, as far as I'm aware, 5.X (if not contact me).

## ğŸ“– Installation

* Download the files and paste them inside your UE project folder
  - For example, let's say you have a UE project named `Kuwahara Filter`
  - Simply paste the downloaded `Content` and `Intermediate` folders inside the folder named `Kuwahara Filter` on your hard drive
* You now have the base material as well as an instance of that material on which you can edit both the x and y radius of the filter
* To use them, create a `Post Process Volume`
* Inside its settings navigate to `Rendering Features > Post Process Materials > Array`
* Create a new element and select the kuwahara filter material instance

> [!NOTE]
>  If the effect of the filter isn't applied in the entire scene, remember to check `Infinite Extent` in the post process' settings.
